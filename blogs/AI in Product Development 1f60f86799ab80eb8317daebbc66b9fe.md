# AI in Product Development

### Honor of a PM

Product Development is one of the most honorable pursuits a man could embark on. It is the attempt to create something out of a sliver of an idea that will make a stranger’s life better and in turn through word of mouth all those around him, and consequently make you some dough. Creating a [good new thing](https://www.paulgraham.com/do.html) and releasing it for the world to make use of its goodness and to enjoy its novelty is as noble a calling as life can offer you. I love Amazon, my iPhone, my AC unit, and my Sony headphones. If it weren’t for these productsI wouldn’t be sat here, amidst the heat wave, having facetimed my mother, listening to the Severance theme while writing this piece. So how do you earn the pleasure of being a product developer?

### It’s mostly human nature

Well, first you need an idea, a good one. Don’t spend too much energy coming up with an idea, rather be deliberate about which ideas you say [no](https://x.com/FoundersPodcast/status/1602650433218314240) to. Ideas are infinite, some are good most are bad, [The good ones chase you.](https://fortune.com/longform/book-excerpt-build-ipod-inventor-tony-fadell/) So don’t be afraid of rejecting a good idea, because it will circle back to nag you and torment you. And when you find it is no longer feasible to ignore this idea, when you feel it’s [burning your gut](https://poets.org/poem/so-you-want-be-writer), that’s when you give in. You don’t choose a good idea a good idea chooses you. 

Make sure the idea is centered around our most honorable cause -making people’s life better-. Make sure the product is one that would benefit lives and cause real impact. 

> The best ideas are painkillers, not vitamins. Vitamin pills are good for you, but they're not essential. You can skip your morning vitamin for a day, a month, a lifetime and never notice the difference. But you'll notice real quick if you forget a painkiller.
- excerpt from [Build, by Tony Fadell](https://www.amazon.com/Build-Unorthodox-Guide-Making-Things/dp/0063046067)
> 

If you find a painkiller, the customers won’t automatically flock to you en masse -medical reps exist for a reason-. You still need to market your product. Create a narrative that feeds into the horribleness of the pain you’re remedying. It’s tempting to play on the glamour of your product. Afterall, The iPod put a 1000 songs in your pocket, Google search gave you the world at your fingertips and Uber got you where you needed to be. But more effective narratives are, the iPod relieved you of the pain of carrying tape around, Google search relieved you of the pain of researching libraries -only to not find what you were looking for in the first place-, and Uber relieved of the pain of taxi drivers in a foreign country. If you can find a narrative the plays on both glamour and relief -like the iPod line-, then I would encourage you to go for it.

### North Star

Once you have your idea and narrative a good idea is to write down the press release of Version 1. This grounds your yet to exist product, it outlines the foundations of what it will be. You’d be surprised how easy it is to go astray. Months into development you’ll find teams disagreeing on basic functionalities, bickering over trivial differences. Time will have allowed each individual to have grown their own perception of the product, and with no document cementing some margins, all hell breaks loose. The arguments breed sensitivity, which in turn stifles growth. Product owners start to feel unheard when they make important suggestions and developers start to feel unappreciated for their work. You want your product owner to remain bold and creative, this bickering will cause him to grow timid. You want your developers to be honest and risk averse, this arguing will cause them to resort to bare minimum practices. 

Instead, create a press release describing your product, marketing it and describing its appeal. Your mantra is still: Painkillers over vitamins. Describe the problem you’re challenging. Describe how you’re going to solve it. Sell a future where by your product this is possible. Once your product is able to reach that press release, don’t look for anymore adjustments release your V1 as long as it’s functional, however imperfect.

> “To write a good press release you have to focus. The press release is meant to hook people—it’s how you get journalists interested in what you’re making. You have to catch their attention. You have to be succinct and interesting, highlight the most important and essential things that your product can do. You can’t just list everything you want to make—you have to prioritize. When you write a press release you say, “Here. This. This is what’s newsworthy. This is what really matters.”
- excerpt from [Build, by Tony Fadell](https://www.amazon.com/Build-Unorthodox-Guide-Making-Things/dp/0063046067)

[Hang](https://app.podscribe.com/episode/133517239#:~:text=And%20he%20goes%20and,best%20in%20their%20field.) the press release on your wall, as a reminder of what to do and what not to do. Be careful not fall in love with engineering. Developing something entirely new is fun but complicated. You might find yourself on long tangents completely unrelated to your mission. These excursions should be done if necessary for the product mission, not despite it. It’s the duty of the PM to make sure your product teams remember their north star. Until release your press release is your second religion. Unless of course, you realize some drastic change that requires you to pivot then don’t be too stubborn. Be careful of what you assign importance to. Beware of what you void. 

### How to Design

Let’s say for example you’re building a finance app. You aim to make people’s lives better by making their finances more accessible. When designing your product consider a stressed mother, she just picked up her kid from middle school. To the dismay of the angsty teenager she has to detour to the grocery store because she’s out of olive oil, behind her the latest offspring in a car seat screaming like there is no tomorrow. It is within these moments people use your app. So for the love of god, be kind. Make it look pretty, make the experience easy. 

### Staying on track

Once you’re motivated to build your good new thing, once the wheel is rolling you’ll find the road is far from paved. Make sure you and the team around you communicate clearly. I won’t bore you with the how to be clear or the importance of it. I think showing you Ken Kocienda’s story about demoing the iPad keyboard to Steve Jobs is enough.

> “I said: “**Right, there are two designs. One has more keys like a laptop keyboard and the other has bigger keys like a scaled up iPhone. We're thinking of offering both. Try the zoom key to switch between them**” 
Steve then slowly swiveled his chair around to the demo table. He looked down in front of him. The iPad was in landscape. Steve moved his eyes all over the iPad screen, rotating his head slowly in small figure eights in what I took to be an attempt to get a view of every corner of the display. After several long moments of study, he reached out to tap the zoom key to switch the keyboard to my bigger keys design, No reaction, No hint of what he was thinking, Steve was like an expert, high-stakes poker player checking his hole cards for the first time after receiving them from the dealer, now that the screen looked different Steve started his study all over again. He took his time, taking a solid 30 seconds to absorb every detail on the screen. He turned to look straight at me.
***”We only need one of these, right?”***
Not what I was expecting. Steve was still looking at me and so with a half shrug I said, 
**”Yeah, I guess so”.** 
Steve sized me up a little and then asked 
***”Which one do you think we should use?*** 
A simple question clearly directed at me and only me. Steve didn't shift in his chair or motion toward anyone else in the room. It was my demo and he wanted me to answer, well, 
**”I've been using these demos for the past few days and I've started to like the keyboard layout with the bigger keys. I think I could learn to touch type on it. And I think other people could too.”**
> 
> 
> Steve continued looking at me as he thought about my answer, he never moved his eyes to anyone or anyone else. He was completely present there. He was seriously considering my idea about the next big Apple product. It was thrilling. He thought for a few seconds, then he announced the demo verdict, 
> ***”Okay, we'll go with the bigger keys”*** 
> 
> That was it. The oracle of Apple had spoken.”
> 

Firstly you can sense Ken’s anxiety and excitedness even in written form. You can sense what value Steve’s guidance provides, you can sense what weight his words posses. Owing to Jobs’ intense clarity you can sense the significance of demoing your work to him. If you are going to guide a product, make sure to maintain that cadence. That calm, confident and clear cadence. You are afterall a [leader](https://x.com/FoundersPodcast/status/1869872955292778902), these traits will reflect on your team and by extension you will all build a product you are at least proud of. 

Don’t confuse clarity with casualness. Although Steve gave his opinion in a little more than a dozen words, he is doing so based on a mountain of [details](https://app.podscribe.com/episode/133517239#:~:text=I%20think%20of,a%20single%20word.). People often misconstrue the brevity of experts as carelessness. They interpret their calm tones as nonchalance, it is far from that. Steve utters these dozen words on the back of countless of hours in meetings where he was truly present, as the consequence of hundreds of failed products and thousands of lost arguments. This preparation earns him the right to be concise. Only with callused hands, can you point the way without having to explain. 

The road ahead is long and weary. If you manage to maintain enough focus to keep track of the details of your work, if you manage to maintain enough energy to keep on remembering the purpose behind your mission, the only obstacle keeping you from your goal is time.  

### Optimism and Potential

Through time I would encourage you to cherish a mantra of optimism. Technology allows us to expand to limitless horizons. Softwares can expand far beyond their initial scope. WeChat turned from a messaging app to literally every single thing there is. Excel turned from a way to store tabular data to a main-stay analysis tool at almost every company on god’s green earth. Airbnb moved from rentals of studio apartments to all sorts of goods and services. **Software has no limit.** 

Your journey is an honorable one. Technology is philanthropic. Markets allow your competitors to reverse engineer any innovation and sell it below your asking price. Giant companies will jump on second mover’s advantage. Every technology will eventually be open-sourced. Therefore one should prioritize impact. Fiscal compensation for a technology created is bound to be less than what you deserve, no one ever pays for WinRAR but it is undoubtedly served humans well.    

Even Jobs, one of the greatest -if not the greatest- PMs to ever live is in awe when reflecting on the products and services he’s dependent on in his every-day life. I encourage you to mirror that fascination if you want to embark on that journey.

### This is pretty complicated, Surely I’ll need to use AI.

Product Development is an intricate pursuit, requiring endless focus and constant attention to detail. Details that span across the lengths of the organization, and the depths of time from ideation to release. If you are someone who has been using AI, you know it can definitely help you make this pursuit a little easier. It can, but it’s not a silver bullet either, I advise you to be categorical on what to use AI on and what not to allow AI to interfere with. Realize that AI is very powerful at extracting context from data, it is very good at synthesizing new data based on existing data. So you can use AI to [summarize a collection of messy data](https://open.substack.com/pub/dpereira/p/how-the-top-1-pms-use-ai?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&timestamp=274.5), or to create a mock ad campaign based on an older theme. 

If you are someone who’s frequently used AI, you know that Large Language Models (LLMs) usually struggle with long context. You also know that when LLMs are unsure of what to tell you they [hallucinate](https://www.iguazio.com/glossary/llm-hallucination/). On the other hand you are on a journey requiring intense focus and attention to detail. Therefore you cannot depend on LLMs to make [decisions](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/3/a-computer-can-never-be-held-accountable/). Whether it be executive or creative. You can use AI to save an analyst’s time, to eliminate some donkey work, to suggest an idea, but allowing it any sort of agency in your organization is a fault you will live to regret. 

Your decisions should be anchored in research, purpose and detail. You might argue: “Well all an LLM does is just come up with one token at a time, and humans share that sequential model of thought”, which is true, but unlike you, the diligent product developer, an LLM’s output is not rooted in research, purpose and detail. Rather it is rooted in what output it can produce which is more probabilistically viable. Which output matches the census data better, which output is more likely to satisfy the user. LLMs are far from critical, and although they are getting better, the very way they are trained and fine-tuned prevent them from being authentic and bound them to [pretentiousness](https://www.paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#:~:text=Don%27t%20try%20to%20work,if%20you%27re%20intellectually%20dishonest%3F). AI can help you interpret data, fill in the reports and write an ad campaign. But unless you know what the data is representing, what insight the report is producing and who’s your demographic for the ad campaign, you are no more useful than a [monkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem#:~:text=The%20infinite%20monkey%20theorem%20states,complete%20works%20of%20William%20Shakespeare.) as a Product Manager. 

### Energy

As with anything honorable product development is not easy. It’s easy to come up with an idea. It’s not easy to come up with an idea that’s viable, we have to respect the constraints of physics and policy. It’s difficult to find untapped potential, you have to commit to an idea that at the start is seemingly dumb. You’ll hear “If it’s that easy someone else would have already built it”, or “Yeah, that’s a good product idea are you sure **you** can make it ?”. 

Perhaps the most challenging is to maintain the energy to build that dumb, difficult product. It will take time - a lot of it-, you will need a team -a good one-, but if your idea is good enough, will it to be. Congratulations you just made the world a better place

This is part of a Series I call AI in Sector X. Where I explore the potential of using AI across a certain sector X by first exploring what the sector demands. Through first principle thinking we are acquainted to what Sector X is, and as a conclusion based on what perspective we gained, it becomes trivial to conclude how AI can be used within Sector X
