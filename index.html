    Projects and blogs have to value readability above all.
    Projects will appear as physical cards on a grid on laptop and under each other on mobile.
    Each card will have a title, a short description, and a link to the project. The cards will be clickable and will take you to the project page. The project page will have a bigger description, a list of technologies used, and a link to the code on github. 
    There will be tags on each card indicating the type of project it is. The tags will be: ML,RAG etc...
